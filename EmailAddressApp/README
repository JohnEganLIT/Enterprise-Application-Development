Simple project to demonstrate how JSPs can be used to create dynamic web content.

A simple HTML form gathers information from the end user. This information is submitted to a JSP via GET.

A scriptlet in the JSP gathers this information from the request and creates Java variables. 

JSP Expressions can then be used in the HTML section of the JSP to echo this information back to the end user.
