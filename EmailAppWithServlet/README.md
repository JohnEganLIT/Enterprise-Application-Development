The purpose of this project was to expand upon the previous iterations of the EmailAddressApp by implementing 
a Servlet to process the request and generate a HTML response.

This project demonstrates the same constructs as the previous SimpleServlet project. 

Both projects used Servlets to produce and return HTML to the browser. However, this is not the typical
(or best) use of Servlets. 

In future projects, Servlets will be used to handle the business processing required by the 
application, and JSPs will be used to return HTML code to the browser. In this way, the application
will combine what works well in both JSPs and Servlets.
