The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how JSP applications can easily work with error pages. 

This is an enhancement of the previous RegularClassesWithJSP project.

The additional variable "age" was added to the User class. Getters, Setters and Constructor were updated.

display_email_entry JSP updated to get the age parameter from the request and parse this input to an Integer.

The application now requires an integer input to process the request. 

If a user enters a String value for their age, for example "thenty three", this will cause the application 
to crash and output an unsightly error message. 

In order to handle the error more gracefully, I created a simple JSP named email_address_app_error with
a generic error message. 

<%@ page errorPage="email_address_app_error.jsp" %> is added to the JSP processing the form. This tells
the JSP engine what page to load if it encounters any errors processing the current page.

<%@page isErrorPage="true" %> attribute in email_address_app_error.jsp specifies that this page can
be used as an error page for another JSP. This attribute is set to false by default.

This error page is displayed no matter what exception is thrown during execution of the JSP.
