The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how regular Java classes can be used by a JSP.

This is an improvement to the previous EmailAddressApp project.

Two simple Java classes are added to the project; User and UserIO. 

The User class is a simple Java class modelling a user of the application. 

UserIO contains one method "writeToFile" that writes the values in a User object to a text file. The
method accepts two paramteres; a User object, and a String that provides a path for the file.

The Page Directive is used in the display_email_entry JSP to import the Java classes.
<%@page import="business.User, data.UserIO" %>

The scriptlet from before is now modified to create a User object from the request parameters. 

A ServletContext object is also created, which is used to convert the web content path to an absolute
disk file system path with the getRealPath() method. The path to where the file is to be created is 
specified as "WEB-INF/EmailList.txt", meaning the text file will appear in the WEB-INF folder once
a User object is submitted.
