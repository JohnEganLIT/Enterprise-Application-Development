The purpose of this project is to give a very simple example of oh Servlets can be used to process
client requests and produce dynamic web pages. Servlets are Java programs that run on a Web Server.

The HttpServlet class is an abstract class that must be extended by all Servlets. A subclass of 
HttpServlet must override at least one method, usually doGet (used to handle get requests from clients) 
or doPost (used to handle post requests from clients).

In this example, the Servlet is called when the end user clicks a link on the index page.

The Servlet's doGet method is Overridden. The response type is set as "text/html". The printWriter 
class is then used to output a basic HTML message to the end user.
